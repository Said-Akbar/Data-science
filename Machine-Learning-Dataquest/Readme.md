## Machine Learning Introduction (DataQuest)

This section is dedicated to tasks from 'Machine Learning Introduction' part of the DataQuest online bootcamp. The bootcamp consists of 8 steps or parts. Introduction to ML is step 6. I have spent 3 months to complete the first five steps. 

The learning process has been quite an interesting journey and I learned various useful data cleaning techniques in Python and SQL queries. I must say that the course concentrates more on technical skills rather than theory (e.g. statistics part lightly touches on probability and hypothesis testing only). I recommend to take this online bootcamp if you want to work on your technical skills such as data cleaning, manipulation, usage of Shell commands and SQL. Once you are confident in your technical skills, you can dive deeper into theory with popular ML books available online.

This step 6 of the bootcamp consists of six topics. I am planning on learning these six topics for a month. The next steps are step 7 (Machine Learning Intermediate) and step 8 (Advanced Topics in Data Science). Overall, it should take around two more months to complete the bootcamp (steps 6, 7, 8).
Here is the outline and approximate schedule for this step 6 (based on my learning habits):
***

Start date: 11/12/2019

Planned Completion date: 12/12/2019

Completion date: In progress

***
### 1. Machine Learning Fundamentals
 - Completion date: 11/16/2019

### 2. Calculus for ML
 - Completion date: 11/17/2019

### 3. Linear Algebra for ML
 - Completion date: 11/19/2019

### 4. Linear Regression for ML
 - Completion date: Paused since 11/21/2019. Will resume after finishing some work.
 - Resumed: 6/12/2020. I will continue from where I left. I found motivation and time to continue again after adjusting to work environment and lots of events such as pandemic and more hit our lives. But continuing the learning is the primary goal from now on.

### 5. ML in Python: Intermediate
 - Completion date: NA

### 6. Decision Trees
 - Completion date: NA
